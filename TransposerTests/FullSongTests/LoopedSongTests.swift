Intro: B2â€¦.
Verse:  	F#2, /A#-G#m7, B | F#2  /A#-G#m7,  C#7 |
F#2, /A#-G#m7, B | F#2  G#m7-B2 |
Chorus: F#7  Bm  F#/A#  G#m7,   F#/A#  B  G#m7  C#7

Look around your world, pretty baby, Is it everything you'd hoped it'd be?
The wrong guy, the wrong situation, The right time to roll to me
Roll to me

And look into your heart, pretty baby, Is it aching with some nameless need?
Is there something wrong and you can't put your finger on it
Right then, roll to me

And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through guess who will be there?

So don't try to deny it, pretty baby, You've been down so long you can hardly see
When the engine's stalled and it won't stop raining, it's the
Right time to roll to me
Roll to me, Roll to me

And I don't think I have ever seen a soul so in despair
So if you want to talk the night through, Guess who will be there?

So look around your world, pretty baby, Is it everything you'd hoped it'd be?
The wrong guy, the wrong situation
F#           G#m       B      F#
The right time to roll to me
